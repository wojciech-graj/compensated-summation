## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Implementation of `Default` for `KahanBabuska` and `KahanBabuskaNeumaier`.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-05-20

### Fixed

- Implementation of `two_sum` and, consequently, `KahanBabuskaNeumaier`.

### Added

- More tests and benchmarks.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-05-14

### Added

- Benchmarks.
- More tests.

### Changed

- `KahanBabuska: std::iter::Sum` and `KahanBabuskaNeumaier: std::iter::Sum` now require an
  `AddAssign` bound instead of `Add`.

  Furthermore, the implementation uses a `for` loop instead of `Iterator::fold`, which improves codegen
  (smaller assembly, though similar performance).

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-14

### Added

- `two_sum` and `fast_two_sum` algorithms.
- `KahanBabuska` and `KahanBabuskaNeumaier` summation.
